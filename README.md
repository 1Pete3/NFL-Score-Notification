# NFL-Score-Notification
This is a personal project where I wanted to use Go and APIs to practice my skills. The point of this project was to send notifications to my phone via text message when NFL games ended. I wanted to send texts of the final scores in every game window so usually 1:00 PM, 4:05 PM, 4:25 PM, 8:15 PM, etc. I was able to find a Google sheet created by [Ryan Buckner](https://www.reddit.com/user/ryanbuckner/) which has game data for every game of the 2024 season. I modified the existing spreadsheet to be better formatted and changed the Google Apps Script associated with the sheet. The changes I made include automatically setting up triggers to run functions. I created triggers to only run on game days and to delete triggers once the  last game of a game day was completed.
